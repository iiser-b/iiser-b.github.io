                                    <p>Sign language is used to communicate with a vast spectrum of people with
                                        special needs. While it is quintessential to ensure we can communicate with
                                        them, most of us are hardly acquainted with it. ESIC, in collaboration with
                                        the Sign Language Research and Training Centre of India (ISLRTC) of the Govt
                                        of India, organized an awareness session on Indian Sign Languages. </p>

                                    <p>On World Mental health day, we made an anonymous platform for people to share
                                        their feelings and thoughts. It involved incidents that gave them hope or
                                        made them feel better or simply smile an expression of gratitude for someone
                                        or something, and rant about absolutely anything. We wanted to make people
                                        realize that they aren’t alone in this, and other people are going through
                                        something similar, if not the same. </p>

                                    <p>A Workshop on Waste Management and Cleanliness.<br>

                                        This workshop was co-organized by Forengers on the occasion of Swacchata
                                        Pakhwada.
                                        This workshop had two aspects, the interaction part, and activity over the week.
                                        We tried to gain a new perspective on making our lives more sustainable through
                                        mindfulness and proactiveness through this initiative. We also had live
                                        demonstrations on how to upcycle waste and a demonstration on making your own
                                        bird feeder.
                                        We also observed a "Zero Waste Week" in between the two sessions.

                                    <p>As a part of our collab series for Jal Shakti Abhiyan, on Independence Day, we
                                        collaborated with EBSB for an exciting event- Plantation Drive.
                                        This event aimed to educate people about the importance of growing trees and
                                        spread the message that tree plantation is not just something that should be
                                        done; instead, it is a necessity, the urgent need of the hour. Planting trees is
                                        crucial to protect our environment against air pollution and global warming.

                                        Under the initiative of Jal Shakti Abhiyan’s “Catch the rain initiative,” we
                                        arranged a talk by Mr. Vishwanath S, also known as the Zenrainman of India, a
                                        renowned water conservation expert.

                                        In this talk, he touched upon how livelihoods can be integrated into the
                                        solution to water scarcity and pollution. Water conservation techniques like-
                                        Rainwater harvesting, lake rejuvenation, and wastewater reuse were also
                                        discussed using case studies from the individual, community, to the metropolis
                                        level.

                                        This challenge aimed to create awareness among people. It also intended to
                                        engage people and motivate them to find and document wildlife in their cities
                                        but with an exciting challenge; Which state in India can document the most
                                        species?
                                        The primary purpose of this event is to embrace the healing powers of nature and
                                        celebrate the biological diversity of India. We attempted to make people more
                                        conscious about their surrounding environment through this community event by
                                        promoting nature walks, sustainable lifestyles, and nature conservation.

                                        On the occasion of Pride Month, we organized a talk “To Be or Not to Be a
                                        Scientist” by Sayantan Datta (they/them), who are a queer-trans science
                                        journalist.
                                        The Talk revolved around the queer-trans people in Indian science &
                                        academia, what science institutions can do to improve the representation of
                                        queer-trans people in science, and what it may mean for science to be queer.

                                        that will take a much-needed break from daily monotonous routines and divert
